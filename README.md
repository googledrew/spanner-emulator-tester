# spanner-emulator-tester

Test project for Google Cloud Spanner Emulator.

This is a tester project for an emulator of Google Cloud Spanner, the horizontally scalable, globally consistent, relational database service from Google. When developing for Google Cloud Spanner, you normally have to do all your development work and testing against an actual Cloud Spanner instance instead of an emulator. This test project contains test cases that are run against a Google Cloud Spanner emulator that could be used for development and test purposes.

Drop me an email if you are interested in a trial account for the emulator (email address can be found on my GitHub profile page).
